The peak in fishing intensity in 2016 and the drop in 2017 are based on erroneous data inputs. There is some information of value of landings missing in the Northern North Sea/Norwegian Trench. Impact indicators (L1 and PD) could not be calculated for c-squares > 200m depth because of data unavailability. 

Temporal patterns in fishing activity are available from 2009 for vessels over 15m and from 2012 for vessels over 12m. Temporal variation in fishing activity hence represents vessels over 15m (2009-2011) and vessels over 12m (2012-2018). The assessment maps and indicator values produced are based on an average for 2013-2018.
