VMS location records are linked to logbook data to associate a location with gear code and fishing activity (Data Collection Framework level 4 and 6 respectively), and with landings weight and landings value records. VMS location records are classified as ‘fishing’ and ‘not fishing’ based on vessel speed and other filters (ICES, 2022). Landings weight and value are then allocated to the VMS location records classified as fishing, based on the time interval between location records or an equal split among location records by day, by ICES rectangle or by trip. Total landings weight or value by c-square, in a given time-interval, are calculated as the sum of the allocations to each location record in that c-square.
