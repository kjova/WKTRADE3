Four indicators were used to describe benthic impacts. These indicators are generated from the assessment methods PD and PD-sens. PD (population dynamics method) is used to estimate the loss of benthic biomass, relative to carrying capacity, from a defined area if the current MBCG fishing intensity continues indefinitely (Pitcher et al., 2017, ICES 2018, 2022, Hiddink et al., 2019). PD-sens (population dynamics method for sensitive fauna) is used to estimate the loss of biomass of sensitive benthic fauna (the 10% most long-lived biomass fraction), relative to carrying capacity, from a defined area if the current MBCG fishing intensity continues indefinitely (ICES, 2024). For this advice, PD and PD-sens are estimated at the c-square scale. 

PD and PD-sens are estimated from SAR and parameters for depletion (proportional mortality) per pass of a MBCG and the intrinsic rate of increase of biomass of the benthic community (Pitcher et al. 2017). Estimates of depletion were m√©tier-specific and taken from Rijnsdorp et al (2020). The intrinsic rate of increase is estimated from the predicted local distribution of maximum ages in an unimpacted benthic community (Rijnsdorp et al 2018). When PD-sens rather than PD is calculated, only the 10% most long-lived biomass fraction of this community is used to estimate the intrinsic rate of increase, to address the component of the benthic biomass most sensitive to MBCG.
