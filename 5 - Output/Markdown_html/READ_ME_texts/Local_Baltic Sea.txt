No fishing activity data is available from Russia.

Temporal patterns in fishing activity are available from 2009 for vessels over 15m and from 2012 for vessels over 12m. Temporal variation in fishing activity hence represents vessels over 15m (2009-2011) and vessels over 12m (2012-2018). The assessment maps and indicator values produced are based on an average for 2013-2018.
