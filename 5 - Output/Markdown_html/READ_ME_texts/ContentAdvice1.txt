This document presents information on the distribution, intensity, impact, and economic value of mobile bottom-contacting gear (MBCG) fisheries within the ECOREG area, and estimated consequences and costs (landings weight and value) of reducing their relative extent. The information is from an assessment for the ECOREG area for the period 2017-2022. The six-year period was selected to include the latest available Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) and logbook data, rather than to match a specific Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) assessment period (EU, 2008). 

The assessment describes fishing intensity and impact with five pressure indicators and four benthic impact indicators (Table E1).
